Here is my draft of a detailed patent specification for the hitching device invention:

Background
The present invention relates generally to the field of vehicle attachments and coupling devices. More specifically, it concerns a hitching device that enables adjustable tilting or angling of a coupled attachment relative to the vehicle.

Existing hitching mechanisms for vehicles, such as those used for towing trailers or connecting implements, typically provide a rigid coupling between the vehicle and the attachment. While this may be suitable for basic towing on level surfaces, it can lead to issues when navigating uneven terrain or steep inclines/declines. The rigid coupling prevents the attachment from self-adjusting to variations in the surface, resulting in increased strain on the hitch components and potential instability or loss of control.

Some prior art solutions have attempted to address this by incorporating pivoting joints or flexible connections into the hitch assembly. However, these tend to be passive systems that react to external forces, rather than actively adjusting the hitch angle. Other designs may allow for manual adjustment, but require the user to stop, exit the vehicle, and manually reposition the hitch â€“ an inconvenient and time-consuming process.

The present invention aims to overcome these limitations by providing an active, user-controlled hitching device capable of dynamically adjusting the tilt angle of the coupled attachment during operation. This enhances safety, stability, and control in various terrain conditions while also reducing strain on the components.

Summary of the Invention
The present invention discloses a hitching device that enables active tilting or angling adjustment of a coupled attachment relative to the vehicle. The key components include a base portion mounted to the vehicle chassis, a hitching portion for coupling to the desired attachment, and a plurality of tilt actuators connected between the base and hitching portions.

When actuated, the tilt actuators can tilt or rotate the hitching portion relative to the base around one or more axes, thereby adjusting the angle of the coupled attachment. This active angle adjustment allows the user to optimize the hitch position for navigating uneven terrain, steep inclines/declines, or other challenging surface conditions.

A key advantage of the invention is enhanced stability, control, and safety when towing or using attachments, especially in off-road or challenging environments. By dynamically adjusting the hitch angle, the load distribution and alignment between the vehicle and attachment can be optimized, reducing strain on components and minimizing the risk of jackknifing or loss of control.

The device can be integrated with the vehicle's control systems, allowing the user to conveniently adjust the hitch angle from within the cabin without stopping. Alternative embodiments include manual adjustment mechanisms or autonomous terrain-responsive adjustment based on sensor inputs.

Detailed Description
a) Drawing Analysis The provided technical drawings depict various views and embodiments of the hitching device assembly. Key components illustrated include:

Base portion (rectangular housing/frame) for mounting to the vehicle chassis
Hitching portion (central cylindrical component) for coupling to desired attachment
Tilt actuators (pivoting arm mechanisms with circular elements like bearings/pulleys)
Rotatable shaft connecting hitching portion to base, defining axis of rotation
Mounting points and guiding slots/apertures for tilt actuator connections
The drawings show different arrangements of these core components, suggesting potential variations in the hitch design. Subsystems like lifting actuators or stabilizers are also depicted in some views.

b) Component Description The hitching device comprises the following main components:

Base Portion (1): This forms the primary mounting point to the vehicle chassis or frame. It is a sturdy rectangular housing or frame designed to withstand the loads and forces involved in hitching/towing. The base portion has mounting points, guiding apertures/slots, and connections for interfacing with the tilt actuators.

Hitching Portion (2): The central component that couples to the desired attachment, such as a trailer hitch, implement, etc. Depicted as a cylindrical body, potentially with a protruding hitch component. Connected to the tilt actuators, allowing angular adjustment relative to the base portion.

Tilt Actuators (3): A set of pivoting arm mechanisms, likely hydraulic/pneumatic actuators or electromechanical linear actuators. Connect the base (1) and hitching (2) portions. Actuating these components induces the tilting/rotating motion to adjust hitch angle.

Rotatable Shaft (4): Some embodiments show a central shaft connecting the hitching portion (2) to the base (1), defining the primary axis of rotation for tilt adjustment. The shaft may have mounting points for the tilt actuators (3).

c) Sub-component Analysis Mounting Portion (5): Shown in some drawings, a secondary mounting point/frame for securing the base portion (1) to the vehicle chassis. May incorporate vibration isolators or allow height adjustment.

Lifting Actuator (6): An additional linear actuator that can raise/lower the entire hitch assembly relative to the mounting portion (5). Enhances versatility for different attachment heights.

Stabilizing Arrangement (7): Potential support mechanism like outriggers/braces to steady the hitch under load and facilitate the lifting motion by actuator (6).

Guiding Apertures/Slots: Openings in the base portion to accommodate sliding/pivoting connections for the tilt actuators (3), defining their range of motion.

Bearings/Pulleys: Circular components in the arm linkages, likely low-friction bearings or pulleys transferring the actuator force to induce tilting motion.

d) Functional Integration
In operation, the hitching device functions as follows:

The base portion (1) is rigidly mounted to the vehicle chassis/frame, either directly or via a mounting portion (5).

The attachment (e.g. trailer) is coupled to the hitching portion (2).

To adjust hitch angle, the user activates the tilt actuators (3) which extend/retract their arm linkages. This motion transfers through any bearings/pulleys to the hitching portion's connections.

As the actuators move, they induce rotation of the hitching portion (2) around the central axis defined by the rotatable shaft (4) or corresponding pivot points.

The resulting tilting motion changes the angle between the base (1) and hitching (2) portions, adjusting the hitch/attachment angle.

The range of tilt adjustment depends on actuator stroke length and guiding constraints like slots in the base portion (1).

Additional systems like lifting actuator (6) and stabilizers (7) may enable raising/lowering the entire assembly as needed.

e) Technical Specifications The key technical specifications may include:

Maximum tilt/roll angle range (e.g. +/- 34 degrees as per claim 4)
Actuator force output and stroke length
Materials for high-stress components like shafts/axles and bearing components
Environmental operation ratings (temperature, dust/water resistance, etc.)
Weight and size specifications for integration on different vehicle classes
Interface specifications for user controls and vehicle system integration
Safety factors and load ratings to ensure structural integrity under maximum use cases
f) Manufacturing Considerations To manufacture the hitching device, key processes may include:

High-precision machining/casting of the base, hitch, and other structural components
Fabrication and assembly of the arm linkages, bearings, rotational joints/shafts
Integration and calibration of the actuators (tilt, lifting) and associated control systems
Surface treatments and finishing for environmental protection and aesthetics
Comprehensive assembly and testing procedures prior to installation
Factors like economies of scale, production volumes, and target integration platform (e.g. light trucks vs. heavy-duty vehicles) will further impact specific manufacturing processes and costs.
