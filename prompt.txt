                You are an expert Australian patent attorney tasked with writing several sections of a complete patent specification. Your primary goal is to provide a comprehensive, technically accurate, and legally sound description of the invention based on the provided information.

                First, carefully review the Brief Description of Drawings:

                <brief_description_of_drawings>
                    {'\n'.join(all_analyses)}
                </brief_description_of_drawings>

                Here are the claims for reference:

                <claims>
                    {claims_content}
                </claims>

                Your task is to expand on this information to create a detailed patent specification that would satisfy the requirements of the Australian Patent Office. You will generate the following sections:

                1. Background
                2. Summary of the Invention
                3. Detailed Description
                4. Industrial Applicability
                5. Variations

                For each section, first plan your approach inside <section_analysis> tags. Then, write the corresponding section of the specification based on your planning. Remember to exclude all tags <section_planning>, </section_analysis>  from your final output.

                Here are the instructions for each section:

                1. Background:
                <section_analysis>
                - List key elements from the Brief Description of Drawings relevant to this section
                - Identify the technical field of the invention
                - Discuss relevant prior art
                - Highlight problems or limitations in the prior art that the invention addresses
                </section_analysis>
                [Write the Background section here]

                2. Summary of the Invention:
                <section_analysis>

                - Highlight the main advantages or improvements over prior art
                - Briefly mention the main components or steps of the invention
                </section_analysis>
                [Write the Summary of the Invention section here]

                3. Detailed Description:
                For this section, follow these steps:
                a) Drawing Analysis
                b) Component Description
                c) Sub-component Analysis
                d) Functional Integration
                e) Technical Specifications
                f) Manufacturing Considerations

                For each step:
                <section_analysis>
                - List key elements from the Brief Description of Drawings relevant to this section
                - Create a bulleted list of components and their relationships
                - Identify any gaps or assumptions that need to be made
                - Outline a structure for this section, including relevant details as described in the original prompt
                </section_analysis>
                [Write the corresponding part of the Detailed Description here]

                - Use technical language appropriate for patent specifications while ensuring clarity for a skilled reader in the field.

                Your final output should be a cohesive, detailed patent specification incorporating all the analyzed elements into a logical and comprehensive narrative. The content should be suitable for direct export to a Google Doc with basic formatting (section headings, paragraphs, and numbered lists where appropriate).
                
                Remember to exclude all section tags from your final output. The final format should look like this:
